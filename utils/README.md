This folder is a dumping ground for useful tools, both diagonostic and for running experiments.

* `jobdispatdher.py` is used to sequentially run a bunch of experiments, without manually needing to run each one.
* `plot.py` is a handy script for making nice plots, say of several training runs
* `eval_model.py` is used to generate statistics about a trained model.
* `loaders.py` contains code for easily loading a pretrained model, and the data loader used to train it
